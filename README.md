This is a IDE for [the Lice programming language](https://github.com/lice-lang/lice),
based on the intellij platform.

It provides syntax highlighting and some structural editing tools.

Apart from syntax highlighting, there're also quick fixes:

Also, you can "Try evaluate" by <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd>
(you may adjust it in the settings page due to conflicting):

You can even replace the current symbol with the evaluated results:
