;; Let's take a look at Lice's IntelliJ IDEA plugin
;; To know how easy it can be to use Lice

(|>
  (print "Hello World\n")
  (print "Bye world\n"))

;; These are some quick fixes

;; This is "Try evaluate"
;; You can use it to figure out how to use Lice's functions properly

;; What is this?
;; Oh, 3 args are needed
;; Do you understand now? :D
;; Let's print them!
(for-each i (.. 2 12) (println i))
;; Oh, unsupported!
;; Let's do "execution" instead of "Try evaluate"!

;; See?

;; Let's try to make a `fold` function

(def fold list init-value op
  (for-each i list (-> init-value (op init-value i))))

;; What's 1+2+3+...+100?
;; Here's the answer :D
(fold (.. 1 100) 0 +)

;; Long output will be displayed in a TextArea
;; Selection and copying is allowed

;; What will happen if we do time-consuming operations?
;; Oh
;; Oh..
(while true (println "Oh no"))
;; 1500ms is the time limit
;; So please do "execution" if timeout :D

;; :D

;; Bye
